## Requirements

You need a PHP,MySQL supported server. For now the following works pretty well

- Firefox (Latest, Mine 13)
- Internet Explorer 
- Opera
- Safari

Also compatible with mobile browsers.

## Things taken care of

- Session handling

This was made long ago so does not rely on any MVC frameworks. A newer version is hosted in Google Codes with OAuth Support.
