This will serve as a basic framework for a Login Registartion system for any event. Specifically tuned for any large Tech_fest r simlar events. Used in EDGE, The annual Technical Fest of Techno India.

## Requirements

You need a PHP,MySQL supported server. For now the following works pretty well

- Google Chrome
- Firefox (Latest, Mine 13)
- Internet Explorer 
- Opera
- Safari

Also compatible with mobile browsers.

## Things taken care of

- Session handling
- SQL Injection
- MD5 salted hash generation for user passwords.

This was made long ago so does not rely on any MVC frameworks. A newer version is hosted in Google Codes with OAuth Support.
